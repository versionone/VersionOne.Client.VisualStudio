# Day-to-Day, Individual Work

The following are not the only things developers want to do but they represent a happy path that should be possible from within their IDE.

## Assign Myself to a Workitem

The team performed sprint planning and we established a set of primary workitems for the current sprint. Now, as a developer, I want to assign myself to the workitems that are most suited to my skills and capacity, so that other people know what I intend to work within the sprint. I assign myself as an "owner" on a series of workitems.

## Task a Primary Workitem

The team performed sprint planning and we established a set of primary workitems for the current sprint. Now, as the owner of one of those primary workitems, I want to quickly task it so that I have a plan that other people on the team can see.

## Start New Work

The sprint has been going for a week now. I've finished my work for a couple other workitems. Now, as the owner of an unstarted primary workitem, I want to signal that I am starting a new workitem so that other team members know what I'm working. I update the workitem's status to "In Progress".

## Track Work

I just spent 2 hours working in the code. Now, as the owner of a primary workitem, I want to record my progress so that other people on the team can know about it. I input the 2 hours of effort. I update the estimate to reflect what I now know is remaining.

## Discover New Work

I have been working on a story. I found a defect with some code the team wrote in the last sprint. As a developer, I want to log a defect so that my product owner can decide the priority in the backlog.

## Refine Understanding

I have been working on a story. Although it wasn't specified at the start of the sprint, I discovered our GUI framework provides an easy way to add a keyboard shortcut and I decided to add it. As a developer, I want to let the team know that I have added this feature so that other team members know to document and test it.

## Signal Work Completed

I just finished the code and unit tests for a workitem. Now, as the owner of the related primary workitem, I want to signal that coding is done so that a tester can take a look at the workitem. I update the workitem's status to "Ready for Test".
